# IOT-project

This is an IOT fall detection project built using python, expressjs, HTML, CSS and mysql. 
This project is developed for the elderly staying at home to respond to their falling. When the camera detects a human falling, It sends a message via telegram. If the user clicks I'm fine, don't hit the alarm, nothing happens. However, if the user doesn't click the "I'm fine" button for a certain amount of time, It will trigger an alarm and send a message via telegram to the elderly's guardian.
